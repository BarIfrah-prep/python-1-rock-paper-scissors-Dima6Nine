# Rock Paper Scissors!
# Hi and welcome to my first assignment!
Here is the first assignment of the course.

# (Rock, Paper, Scissors Game)
The code is a simple dictionary where every element has its own dictionary value/
with different result for each element.
After the user choices his option (1,2,3) the code converts the nested dictionary to list and gets/
The first element according to the instructions. if the user didn't pick the right option/
There is a While loop which check for str and int in range until the user makes the right choice./
After that the random randrange function is picking for the pc the figure number the same way/
as the users one and saves it inside. and at last we take the users input and the pc value/
to get the corresponding result for the users choice from the dict value.
